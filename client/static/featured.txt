I was looking for a new things and stumbled upon ReRe. At first I thought it was pretty simple but now I played it and couldn't stop.
I repeat and repeat 'lol' and 'lol' again. Some effects are very amusing and absurd. It's super fun.
By just playing you can learn new thing about famous peoples, fictional characters, animals, plants, etc. Great app 5 of 5.
So many interesting effects images and their combination around. I can play forever and never get tired.
Some questions just nailed me. It's ridiculously fun quiz. Sometimes effects just outstanding!!1
Great game to test your memory and mindfulness. Very educational, interesting, and addictive experience.
I just press redo button in ReRe, and get so much fun with effects and deformations )))
